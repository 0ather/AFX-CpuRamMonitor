## Installation instructions

Adobe removed support for the Extension Manager in CC 2015, so you will need to manually install the extension. Don't worry, it's not so complex!

### OSX

1. [Download the extension](https://github.com/0ather/AFX-CpuRamMonitor/archive/master.zip)

2. Launch Terminal and run this command to open the install folder (or open the folder yourself with CMD+Alt+G in finder):

	```
	open /Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/
	```

	If the folder doesn't exist, you can create it.

3. Copy the unzipped CPU-Ram-Monitor folder into the extensions folder.
