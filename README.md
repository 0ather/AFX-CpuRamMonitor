# CPU-RAM Monitor for After Effects

This extension for After Effects (CC / CC 2014 / CC 2015) allows you to always have a look to your CPU and Memory usage without opening any task manager.


## Installation instructions

Adobe removed support for the Extension Manager in CC 2015, so you will need to manually install the extension. Don't worry, it's not so complex!

### OSX

1. [Download the extension](https://github.com/0ather/AFX-CpuRamMonitor/archive/master.zip)

2. Launch Terminal and run this command to open the install folder (or open the folder yourself with CMD+Alt+G in finder):

```
open /Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/
```

If the folder doesn't exist, you can create it.

3. Copy the unzipped CPU-Ram-Monitor folder into the extensions folder.

4. After restarting After Effects, you'll see the extension under Window -> Extensions -> CPU-RAM Monitor.

### Windows

1. [Download the extension](https://github.com/0ather/AFX-CpuRamMonitor/archive/master.zip)

2. Copy the unzipper CPU-Ram-Monitor folder into the appropriate directory:

  - Windows 32: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions\

If the folder doesn't exist, you can create it.
